| Backend | Node.js, Express, Sequelize, SQLite (dev/test) |
| Frontend | React 18, Redux Toolkit, React Router v6, MUI 5 |
| Testing (backend) | Jest, Supertest |
| Testing (frontend) | React Testing Library, Jest |
| Tooling | TypeScript, npm workspaces |

## Local Development (Windows PowerShell)
Prerequisites: Node.js >= 18.

Install (root will install workspaces):
```powershell
npm install
```

Run backend & frontend concurrently (scripts wrap startup):
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Run tests:
```powershell
# Backend tests
npm run test:backend

# Frontend tests (non-watch)
npm run test:frontend

# All
npm test
```

Type checking:
```powershell
npm run typecheck
```
