## üé® CUSTOMER DEMO SCRIPT

### Opening (30 seconds)
"This is Bal-Con Builders, a comprehensive construction management platform built specifically for **your industry**. Unlike generic project management tools, every feature here is designed for the unique workflows of commercial and residential construction."

### Health Score Dashboard (60 seconds)
"Here's the Owner Dashboard - the first thing you see each morning. This **Health Score Ring** gives you instant visibility into your business health across three critical metrics:
- On-Time Delivery: 95% (green - excellent)
- Budget Adherence: 88% (yellow - needs attention)
- Customer Satisfaction: 93% (green - strong)

The AI insights below suggest **prioritizing material procurement** to improve that 88% budget score. That's actionable intelligence, not just data."

### Weather Safety (45 seconds)
"Now watch this - let me switch to the Technician view. See this **Weather Widget** at the top? It's pulling live weather data and automatically calculating work suitability. Right now it's 78¬∞F with light winds - perfect conditions, so work is **allowed**. But if temps drop below freezing or winds exceed 25 mph, this turns red and recommends **work restrictions** for safety. Your field teams get this real-time intelligence on their tablets."

### Mobile Experience (30 seconds)
"Let me resize this to mobile - see how everything adapts? Those buttons are **48 pixels minimum** - perfect for gloved hands in the field. The deep blue theme and orange accents aren't just pretty - they're **construction industry standard colors** that your team will immediately recognize."

### Closing (15 seconds)
"This is ready for your team **today**. All the features you need - project tracking, budget management, team coordination, real-time updates - with a design that actually understands construction workflows."

## üìû SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Backend Fails to Start
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs --service Balcon`
2. Verify environment variables: `railway variables -s Balcon`
3. Ensure DATABASE_URL is set to PostgreSQL connection string
4. Check migrations ran successfully (look for "Migrations complete" in logs)

### If Frontend Shows Blank Screen
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API_URL environment variable points to backend
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Test backend health endpoint directly

### If Login Fails
1. Verify backend is responding: curl health endpoint
2. Check JWT_SECRET is set in backend environment
3. Try password reset flow (if implemented)
4. Verify user exists in database: check seed data logs

### Emergency Rollback
If deployment fails catastrophically:
```bash
# Rollback to last known good deployment (Sept 24)
railway service  # Select "Balcon"
# In Railway dashboard: Deployments tab ‚Üí Sept 24 success ‚Üí Redeploy
```

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Monitor deployments** (5-10 minutes):
   - Frontend build completion
   - Backend startup and health checks
   - Database connection establishment

2. **Run verification checklist** above

3. **Test customer demo script** with stopwatch (target: under 3 minutes)

4. **Document any new issues** encountered during testing

5. **Schedule customer demo** once all checks pass
