# Balcon Builders Project Cleanup & Local Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This is a comprehensive operational management system for Bal-Con Builders, a Texas-based metal building construction company. The system is designed to improve operational efficiency at every level of the company.

## ðŸš¨ Current Issues Identified

### 1. Multiple Application Versions
- Multiple app entry points causing confusion
- Inconsistent database configurations
- Environment variable conflicts

### 2. Database State
- Multiple SQLite files with unclear purposes
- Missing proper migration structure
- Inconsistent seeding

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Frontend configured for Supabase but backend uses SQLite
- Port conflicts between services
- Missing required environment variables

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Steps

### Phase 1: Environment Standardization

1. **Consolidate Application Entry Points**
   - Choose primary application version (Enhanced version recommended)
   - Remove or archive outdated versions
   - Standardize startup scripts

2. **Database Cleanup**
   - Remove redundant database files
   - Establish single source of truth for development
   - Ensure proper migration system

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Align frontend and backend configurations
   - Ensure port consistency
   - Add missing required variables

### Phase 2: Dependency Resolution

1. **Backend Dependencies**
   - Clean install of all packages
   - Resolve version conflicts
   - Update deprecated packages

2. **Frontend Dependencies**
   - Clean install React dependencies
   - Resolve Material-UI version issues
   - Update React scripts

### Phase 3: Local Development Setup

1. **Database Initialization**
   - Reset and recreate database
   - Run migrations
   - Seed with demo data

2. **Service Startup**
   - Start backend server
   - Start frontend development server
   - Verify connectivity

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Commands

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run db:reset:enhanced
npm run db:seed:enhanced
npm run dev:enhanced
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome

After cleanup, you should have:
- âœ… Single, working backend API on port 8082
- âœ… React frontend on port 3000
- âœ… Working authentication system
- âœ… Demo users for all role types
- âœ… File upload functionality
- âœ… Real-time WebSocket communication
- âœ… Complete project management workflow

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps After Local Setup

1. **Feature Testing**
   - Test all user roles and permissions
   - Verify project workflow
   - Test file upload/download
   - Validate real-time features

2. **Data Migration**
   - Import actual company data
   - Configure production database
   - Set up backup systems

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Configure Google Cloud Platform
   - Set up production environment variables
   - Deploy and test production build

## ðŸ“± Mobile Considerations

The current system is web-based but could be enhanced with:
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Offline capability for field workers

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

Current security implementations:
- JWT authentication with role-based access
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- File upload validation
- CORS protection
- Helmet security headers

## ðŸ“Š Business Impact

This system will improve:
- **Project tracking** from quote to completion
- **Communication** between office and field teams
- **File management** for project documents
- **Customer experience** with real-time updates
- **Operational efficiency** through automation
