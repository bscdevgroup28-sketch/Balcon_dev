SystemHealthPage
├── Header (Title + Auto-Refresh Toggle + Manual Refresh)
├── Overall Status Card (Hero Section)
│   ├── Status Icon (CheckCircle/Error)
│   ├── System Status Message
│   ├── Last Update Timestamp
│   └── Overall Health Chip
├── Grid Container
│   ├── Backend API Card
│   │   └── Status, Response Time, Uptime, Environment, Version
│   ├── Database Card
│   │   └── Connection, Latency, Migrations
│   ├── Job Queue Card
│   │   └── Handlers, Concurrency, Status

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Load** - Fetches `/api/health/deep` on component mount
2. **Auto-Refresh** - Polls every 5 seconds if enabled
3. **Manual Refresh** - User clicks refresh button
4. **Error Handling** - Displays error alert if API fails
5. **Loading State** - Shows linear progress during fetch

### Health Endpoint Used

**Backend**: `/api/health/deep` (existing endpoint)

**Response Structure**:
```typescript
{
  ok: boolean,
  timestamp: string,
  status: string,
  uptime: number,
  latencyMs: number,
  version: string,
  environment: string,
  checks: { database: string },
  migrations: { pending: number, executed: number },
  queue: { handlers: number, concurrency: number },
  exports: { running: number, failed: number },
  webhooks: { pending: number, failed: number }
}
```

## 🎯 Thresholds & Alerts

### Performance Targets
- ✅ **API Response Time**: < 200ms (green), 200-500ms (yellow), > 500ms (red)
- ✅ **DB Query Time**: < 50ms (green), 50-200ms (yellow), > 200ms (red)

### Service Health
- ✅ **Migrations Pending**: 0 (green), > 0 (yellow warning)
- ✅ **Export Failures**: < 5 (green), ≥ 5 (yellow degraded)
- ✅ **Webhook Failures**: < 10 (green), ≥ 10 (yellow degraded)
- ✅ **Webhook Pending**: < 10 (default), ≥ 10 (yellow warning)

### Overall Status Logic
- **Healthy (Green)**: `health.ok === true`
- **Degraded/Error (Red)**: `health.ok === false` or API error

---

## 🔒 Security & Access Control

### Protected Route
- **Roles Required**: `['admin', 'owner']`
- **Authentication**: JWT token required
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control enforced

### Why Admin/Owner Only?
- Sensitive system information
- Performance metrics
- Infrastructure details
- Migration status
- Job queue internals

**Demo Accounts with Access**:
- `owner@balconbuilders.com` - Owner role ✅
- `admin@balconbuilders.com` - Admin role ✅

2. **Performance Monitoring** - Check API/DB response times
3. **Troubleshooting** - Identify degraded components
4. **Capacity Planning** - Monitor job queue, exports
5. **Migration Status** - Verify database migrations

### For Owners
1. **System Overview** - High-level operational status
2. **Uptime Monitoring** - Verify system availability
3. **Version Tracking** - Confirm deployed version
4. **Environment Verification** - Ensure correct environment

### For Operations/DevOps
1. **Pre-Deployment Check** - Verify system health before deploys
